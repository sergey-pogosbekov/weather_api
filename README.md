# Ngrx Example

This project is a simple example of how to use [NgRx](https://github.com/ngrx/platform).
This project also was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.2.

## Implementation

In this project you'll find simple implementation of the following ngrx packages:

* [@ngrx/store](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/blob/master/docs/store/README.md) - RxJS powered state management for Angular applications, inspired by Redux
* [@ngrx/effects](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/blob/master/docs/effects/README.md) - Side Effect model for @ngrx/store to model event sources as actions.
* [@ngrx/store-devtools](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/blob/master/docs/store-devtools/README.md) - Store instrumentation that enables a powerful time-travelling debugger.
* [@ngrx/entity](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/blob/master/docs/entity/README.md) - Entity State adapter for managing record collections.

## Understanding NgRx

To understand how NgRx works, I recommend you to read the blog post [NgRx: Patterns and Techniques](https://blog.nrwl.io/ngrx-patterns-and-techniques-f46126e2b1e5) by [Victor Savkin](https://github.com/vsavkin).

## Running

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
